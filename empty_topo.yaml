############## Dictionary of a topology ##########
#
# My aim is that this will get generated via some DSML
# such as the one we can create in our model-driven
# engineering environment called WebGME (www.webgme.org)
# and so will generate information that is correct-by-construction.
# Right now, because it is being created manually, mistakes can still
# be made. For this triangle topology, things appear to work correctly.

# Think of this YAML schema as the domain-specific language
# in which the topology is described. Thereafter, it is fed to a
# generic back-end orchestration middleware, which generates
# the desired topology.
